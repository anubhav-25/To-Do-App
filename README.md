1. Purpose: A todo app is a software application designed to help users organize, manage, and prioritize their tasks and responsibilities.

2. Task Creation: Users can create new tasks or todos within the app. These tasks typically include a title or description of the task, and sometimes additional details like due dates, priorities, or categories.

3. Organization: Todo apps often provide features to organize tasks, such as creating lists or projects, assigning tags or labels, and categorizing tasks by importance, urgency, or type.

4. Prioritization: Users can prioritize tasks based on their importance or urgency. Some todo apps allow users to assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) or mark tasks as "urgent" or "important."

5. Scheduling: Users can schedule tasks for specific dates and times. Todo apps may include calendar views or integrations with calendar apps to help users plan their tasks over time.

6. Reminders: Todo apps often include reminder features to alert users about upcoming tasks or deadlines. These reminders can be delivered through notifications on the user's device, email, or other communication channels.
